is used to refer method of functional interface.
## Types of Method References
* There are following types of method references in java:

### Reference to a static method.

   1. you must create interface and create abstract methode on it
   2. then create variable type of  interface assigned to static methode(must be like of abstract methode in type and passes variable) in  the class you went
      > class:: static methode
   3. if you went to call methode :
   
      > variable.abstractMethodeOf()

### Reference to an instance method.
   1. create interface with abstract methode
   1. crete instance of any class you want
  
   1. create instance form any class yoi went
   2. create variable type interface assigned to instance::non-static methode (e(must be like of abstract methode in type and passes variable)) in class
   1. if you went to call the methode
   > varible.abstactMethode

### Reference to a constructor.

1. create interface with abstract methode
2. create variable type interface assigned to class::new  (the constracer must be like of abstract methode in type and passes variable)
